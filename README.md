Vibecoded with google gemini. I have no idea how to write python code

v1.1

changes:
- added icons
- quick selection navigation with NumPad_1, 2, 3 and 5: 1 selects first frame of f-curves and you can switch them with NumPad_3. 5 is adding to selection to the right. 2 is deleting selection from the right
- selection dependant framerange: When animation is NOT playing the numpad selections change the cursor position. When animation in playing 
- slide operator
- flatten operator
- scale keyframe in x operator (relative to first selected keyframe)
- move keyframe in x

- Various Random Operators
- "On bones" option which does not randomize every selected channel, but the selected bone as a whole (Useful with randomize x-value for timing randomization with different bones)
- isolate bones option 
- customizable selection dependant framerange (when animation is playing)
- move to cursor operator (Move selected keys to timeline cursor. reverse operation for random x-value)
- decimate keyframes operator:

- rotation strength is now also dependant on next keyframe
